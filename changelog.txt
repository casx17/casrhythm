    (4/26/25) awesome first changelog yea

    [i started the project on 4/21/25-
    i thought that was probably important to mention but i couldnt figure out where to put it so its going here]

    this is the first changelog!! this is the first time ive had just a fully working game and everything so
    i felt like this would be a good time to write a changelog.

    i cant put everything i made in a sentence so ill be doing bullets

        - test song for testing stuffs
        - a cool system where charts, metadata and songs are saved to your appdata
        - a song manager that handles charts, metadata, playing the music, etc
        - saving and loading charts and metadata
        - automatic chart sorting to put notes that come first FIRST in the chart table
        - number to time converter (takes number in seconds and turns it into 0:00 minute format)
        - cool notepads that resize when you press them
        - ACTUAL FALLING NOTES (that arrive on time regardless of scroll speed)
        - settings manager (keybinds, downscroll, and botplay so far)
        - INPUT based on the keybinds
        - a ratings system with a table full of editable timing windows
        - a song position bar

    the next big goal is for sure the chart editor
    but that probably wont take super long COMPARED to everything else
    itll still probably take forever though

    anyway im writing this at like 5am so im going to bed byebye
